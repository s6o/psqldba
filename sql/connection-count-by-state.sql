-- The possible states of interest are:
-- active                        | Connections currently executing queries. A large number tends to indicate DB slowness.
-- idle                          | Idle connections, not in a transaction.
-- idle in transaction           | Connections with an open transaction, not executing a query. Lots of these can indicate long-running transactions.
-- idle in transaction (aborted) | Connection is in a transaction, but an error has occurred and the transaction hasnâ€™t been rolled back.
